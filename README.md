Code for CACAIE paper [Deep convolutional neural networks for random field uncertainty propagation](https://xihaier.github.io/)

## Summary
A machine learning approach is proposed for quantifying the effect of spatial variabilities in coupled elliptic systems. The learning model takes a hierarchical form where deep convolutional neural networks are used as the underlying components.

The learning process of this field-to-field mapping is efficient as distant connections among nonadjacent layers are established to improve the model efficiency in terms of training and deploying.
